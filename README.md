# Event Administration

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.1.

## Deployment on Firebase
[Deployed here!](https://events-app-230f8.web.app/)

## Frameworks and libraries used
- **Angular**: due to the fact I am very familiar with its logic. Besides, it is a framework with a number
of functionalities like routing, reactive forms, typescript, rxjs etc. that facilitate clean and easily unit testable code
- **Angular Material**: because it comes with a number of components and css that facilitates responsive UI design
- **Angular Material components Date-Time picker**: because I needed a single component that provides you both with
  date and time functionalities
- **uuid**: in order to add unique ids for the events so that we can view their details on a unique route url
- **jest**: because it is faster than karma + fewer configurations
